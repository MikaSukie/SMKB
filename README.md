# A simple macro script made in python.<br>
An example script is: <br>
```python
mouse|hold=14000|button=left || a|hold=14000 ; mouse|rel=180|dist=50|move=1000; mouse|hold=14000|button=left || a|hold=14000 ; stop
```
<br>
The chant above is for a skyblock farm with 2 sides of wheat, melon, etc, to hold left click, and A and then turn 180 deg and do the same until the end of the farm. (currently 14s)
